Every day, the world is becoming more connected; your freezer can talk to your television, your door bell can call your phone, your cat can have deep, meaningful conversations with your dog! Okay, maybe not that last one; but you get the idea. The goal of Surround is to integrate all of the IOT devices in your life with _you_, by retreiving data from Apple HealthKit, and allowing that data to control the world around you.
